Unlike traditional heatmaps that track clicks (engagement), this tracks *hesitation*. We can see exactly which button, label, or chart is causing the most friction, filtering out the noise to reveal high-fidelity patterns of struggle.\n\n### Automating the Feedback Loop\n\nThe ultimate goal isn\'t just to answer questions\u2014it\'s to eliminate the need for them. \n\nSage operationalizes this insight through threshold-based logic. If a specific UI element generates a high volume of queries (e.g., "What does \'Health Score\' mean?"), the system triggers an automated workflow:\n\n1.  **Signal Detection:** The system identifies a "Hotspot" of confusion.\n2.  **Context Injection:** It captures the element ID, frequency of clicks, and user query topics.\n3.  **Ticket Generation:** It automatically creates a Jira ticket populated with this data.\n\nThis process removes subjectivity from prioritization. Instead of debating what to fix, the engineering backlog becomes populated with tasks that are **quantifiably proven to be high-friction**, ensuring our development cycles are always directly aligned with verified user needs.'})]})}function u(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,o.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,a.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,a.jsx)(h,{...e})}):h(e)}},8964:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{A:()=>i});const i=n.p+"assets/images/sage-hero-e2f9a0728565fd3601b02c50b8ed0d39.png"}}]);
