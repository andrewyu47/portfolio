## The Problem: "Paper Cuts" in the Workflow

In complex enterprise dashboards, users often encounter metrics, charts, or abbreviations they don't understand. We call these "Paper Cuts."

When a user is confused, they usually:
1.  **Break flow:** Open a new tab to search documentation.
2.  **Context switch:** Ping a teammate on Slack.
3.  **Give up:** Ignoring the feature entirely.

For the Product Team, this creates a **Blind Spot**. We know users are struggling, but we don't know *exactly* which UI elements are causing the friction. We rely on lagging indicators like support tickets, often weeks after the frustration occurred.

## The Solution

We built **Sage**, a visitor-driven AI framework. Instead of a generic chatbot, Sage allows users to **draw a box** around any specific element in the UI to get an instant, context-aware explanation.

But the real innovation isn't just the answer—it's the data we capture.

### The "Confusion Map" Architecture

Sage closes the loop between User Confusion and Product Improvement. Every time a user selects an area for help, we log that interaction as a "Confusion Signal."
