title: Splunk IX AI Council

# Founded the IX AI Council at Splunk

## ⚡ The Impact
* **Increased content velocity by 25%** via GenAI workflows.
* **Architected** the internal prompt library used by 60+ staff.
* **Defined** the governance model for AI-assisted documentation.

## 📝 The Challenge
Splunk's technical content team needed to scale output without adding headcount, but we lacked a governance framework for using LLMs safely. There was no standard for "human-in-the-loop" review.

## 🛠️ The Solution
I established the IX AI Council to bridge the gap between Engineering, Legal, and Content.

### 1. Prompt Engineering
I built a shared library of system prompts stored in Git, allowing writers to treat prompts as code.

### 2. The Tooling
We utilized Codex and internal LLMs to automate simple style reviews.

## 📊 The Results
* Reduced audit time by **40%**.
* Zero legal/compliance incidents during the pilot phase.
